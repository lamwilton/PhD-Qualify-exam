## Proposal 1: Synthesis and Structural Modifications of Antiviral Natural Product Cavinafungin A  
Cavinafungin A, a natural product isolated from the fungus Colispora cavincola, was recently discovered to potently and selectively inhibit Zika and dengue viral reproduction in human host cells. It binds and inhibits host signal peptidase SPC18, which processes viral structural proteins for viral reproduction. In pursuance of inventing urgently needed therapies against these viruses, I hereby propose an in vitro method to study the inhibitory kinetics of cavinafungin A, as well as structural analogs that will render the natural product as a suitable drug candidate (Figure 1). Hence, the experimental results may move us a step closer to developing a new antiviral drug to treat both Zika fever and dengue fever.  
## Proposal 2: Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Commiphoranes A and B  
Commiphoranes A and B isolated from Resina commiphora were recently found to inhibit organ fibrosis. They have the potential to be developed as novel therapies against this disease. The total synthetic plans for these compounds are presented in this proposal. The key steps include closing ring A by an improved Friedel-Crafts acylation protocol, as well as performing an intramolecular Heck reaction to construct the C-11 stereocenters.
